Overview
--------

On this page, you can find a list of MongoDB and {+framework+} features that
are not supported by the {+provider-long+}. Because the provider is in active
development, some features listed on this page might be considered for future
releases based on customer demand.

MongoDB Features
----------------

The following sections discuss MongoDB features that are not supported by the {+provider-short+}.

Time Series
~~~~~~~~~~~

The {+provider-short+} does not support time series data or time series
collections. This is a MongoDB-exclusive feature that isn't available with {+framework-core+}.

Atlas Search
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The {+provider-short+} does not support MongoDB Atlas search. Atlas Search is a
MongoDB-exclusive feature with no similar feature available in {+framework-core+}.

Vector Search
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The {+provider-short+} does not support MongoDB Atlas Vector search. Atlas Vector Search is a
MongoDB-exclusive feature with no similar feature available in {+framework-core+}.

{+framework-core+} Features
------------------------------

The following sections discuss {+framework-core+} features that are not
supported by the {+provider-short+}.

Migrations
~~~~~~~~~~

Migrations in {+framework-core+} are designed for relational databases. Because
MongoDB is a document database, migrations are not supported by the
{+provider-short+} at this time.

Database-First Development
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB is designed to be flexible and does not require a database schema.
Because of this schemaless design, database-first development is not supported
in the {+provider-short+}. 

Foreign Keys
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Because MongoDB is a document database, {+provider-short+} does not support foreign keys.

Alternate Keys
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Because MongoDB is a document database, the {+provider-short+} does not support alternate keys.

Table Splitting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MongoDB is a document database and does not have traditional normalized tables.
Because of this, table splitting has limited use and is not supported by the
{+provider-short+}.

Temporal Tables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The {+provider-short+} does not support temporal tables.

Spatial Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The {+provider-short+} does not support spatial data.
